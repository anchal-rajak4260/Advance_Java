Java AWT Basics
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API used to create Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Windows-based Java programs and Java AWT components are platform-dependent, which means they are shown in accordance with the operating systemâ€™s view. AWT is heavyweight, which means that its components consume resources from the underlying operating system (OS). The java.awt package contains AWT API classes such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List, and so on.

Java AWT or Abstract Window Toolkit is an API used for developing GUI(Graphic User Interfaces) or Window-Based Applications in Java. Java AWT is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that provides a way to build platform-independent graphical applications.

Why AWT is Platform Independent?
The Java AWT utilizes the native platform subroutine to create API components such as TextField, CheckBox, and buttons. This results in a different visual format for these components on different platforms such as Windows, MAC OS, and Unix.

1. Components: AWT provides various components such as buttons, labels, text fields, checkboxes, etc used for creating GUI elements for Java Applications.
2. Containers: AWT provides containers like panels, frames, and dialogues to organize and group components in the Application.
3. Layout Managers: Layout Managers are responsible for arranging data in the containers some of the layout managers are BorderLayout, FlowLayout, etc.
4. Event Handling: AWT allows the user to handle the events like mouse clicks, key presses, etc. using event listeners and adapters.
5. Graphics and Drawing: It is the feature of AWT that helps to draw shapes, insert images and write text in the components of a Java Application.
